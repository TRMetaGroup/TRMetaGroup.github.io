#### 1. Personnel Composition

TR Meta Lab consists of a team comprising a professor (fully)<a href="https://trmetagroup.github.io/team/researcher-name"> [Chen Wang]</a>,  6 PhD students and over 20 Master's students.  The detailed information of all members can be found  <a href="https://trmetagroup.github.io/team/"> [here]</a>

#### 2. Research Directions

The main research directions of TR Meta Lab include but are not limited to:

* **Intelligent transportation systems**, especially AI-based vehicle-road cooperative perception technology. The team focuses closely on perception tasks such as detecting traffic participants, road accidents/anomalies, and recognizing/predicting pedestrian crossing intentions/trajectories. By integrating advanced technologies such as deep CNN/transformer networks, few-shot learning, domain adaptation, and multimodal large models, the team has achieved efficient and precise perception at the road and vehicle levels. This lays a solid foundation for the intelligent and automated development of intelligent transportation systems.

* **Active traffic safety**： with a commitment to explore every available avenue for reducing fatalities and serious injuries on roadways. The team's focus lies in analyzing crash factors, uncovering the coupling relationship related to driving behavior, road alignment/environment, etc., and utilizing safety indicators to measure the spatial and/or temporal proximity of safety-critical events. Moreover, the team is dedicated to providing active intervention and risk alerting for high-risk scenarios by integrating V2X and ADAS technology, thus providing invaluable insights for crash prevention and roadway design.

* **Intelligent/Autonomous driving**： 

#### 3. Research Output

Under the leadership of Wang, the lab has published **over 70 journal articles**  in top-tier journals such as *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems*, *Transportation Research Part C/F, Accident Analysis and Prevention*, and *Automation in Construction* , as well as presented more than **20 conference papers** (such as Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting) and related reports at international conferences. Additionally, the team has been granted/published **30 Chinese invention patents** and authored a Chinese textbook titled 'Road Traffic Visual Perception Technology and Applications'.
