    Our team introduces a groundbreaking study on modeling the risk of single-vehicle run-off-road (SVROR) crashes using connected vehicle data. This study proposes a SVROR crash risk measure (SVROR-CRM) based on the concept of tetraquark in particle physics to model SVROR crash risks. It utilizes high-resolution connected vehicle data, which is getting increasingly available, to mathematically model the interactions between a single vehicle and the roadway. The proposed SVROR-CRM is validated using connected vehicle data (over 2 million trajectories) and SVROR crash data from sixteen horizontal curves on I-80 in Wyoming. The validation results suggest that the risk estimates generated by SVROR-CRM match the observed SVROR crashes very well. Also, the validation study shows the importance of considering both position deviation risk and attitude deviation risk.The proposed approach bridges an important gap in crash risk measure research and can be used to identify unsafe trajectories and high-crash locations and/or periods to SVROR crashes on highway horizontal curves.
